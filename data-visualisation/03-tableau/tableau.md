## Workspace page

Go here by clicking in the bottom Sheet 1. This is where we will create most of our visualisations.



**Toolbar** has quick access to most used functionalities. 

**Data/analytics Panes**. Switch between them by clicking in the top of the pane.

### Column vs rows

![CleanShot-2024-06-26-at-09.37.24](assets/CleanShot-2024-06-26-at-09.37.24.png)



The column and rows decides what should be displayed as columns or rows. It decides how data is visualized on a worksheet. 



 Fx here country is as columns:

#### Pages shelf

Seperate the current visualisation into seperate pages. 

Say fx i wanted to see product sales divided into category and sub-category by each country. Then i drag Countries to pages. Now in the right there is a page where i can control the countries by clicking on the buttons with arrows.

#### Filters

Here we can also drag a field and filter that data, specifying what we want to filter out. 



#### Marks

This can be used for designing the visual. Drag a field on top of either Colour, Size or Label. Label will just show the text



#### Visualisation view

Marks could be lines, bars, circles, etc.

#### Show me

Contains the different visualisations that are available. If there are visualisations that are greyed out. That means they cannot be used. In the bottom you can see what you need to do to activate it. For the example in the screenshot it needs 1 date, no dimensions and 1 or more measures.

#### Measure vs dimensions

Measure are numbers, Discount, sales, quantity, etc. You can see them beneath the line in the data pane where they have a green color. Continuous

Dimensions are text Country, customer name, region, category. Discrete. 

Date can be both a measure or a dimension, why?

### Measure names and Measure values

Measure names is a representation of all the measures we have. Measure values is a representation of all the values we have, from smallest to largest. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uhOlZhN5GU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uhOlZhN5GU)

With these values we can show multiple marks using the same axes. 

If we do measure names we can basiscally filter those measures showing only the ones we are interested in. 



### Same axis multiple measures

### Axis

Same axes, different axis, dual axis: [https://youtu.be/K3pXnbniUcM?si=s8HqU_FkEy-7wtzP&t=55310](https://youtu.be/K3pXnbniUcM?si=s8HqU_FkEy-7wtzP&t=55310)
