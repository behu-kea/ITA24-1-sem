### Cognitive load

Cognitive load: Cognitive load can be thought of as the mental effort that’s required to learn new information. 

Humans have two types of memory:

- Long term
- Short term 7 +- 2 items

Humans’ brains have a finite amount of this mental processing power. As designers of information, we want to be smart about how we use our audience’s brain power.

In general, think about minimizing the perceived cognitive load (to the extent that is reasonable and still allows you to get the information across) for your audience.

### Clutter

Clutter can make something feel more complicated than it actually is.

Remember that we choose the graph that is easiest for your audience to understand



Try and think about what your brain does when it sees this graph

This kind of strain is what we want to avoid putting on our users



**Exercise**

Create a data visualisation that on purpuse is cluttered and takes some time for our users to understand.

- Have unnessary information
- Use language that the users dont understand
- Have many elements and lots of things going on
  - We want to bombard their brain with information



### Gestalt laws

In the 1920s, a group of German psychologists developed theories around how people perceive the world around them, called Gestalt principles.

Detail how our brains create structure by default



#### Proximity

The principle of proximity states that things that are close together  appear to be more related than things that are spaced farther apart.

#### Similarity

The principle of similarity states that when things appear to be similar to each other, we group them together. And we also tend to think they  have the same function.

#### Enclosure

When objects are located within the same closed region, we perceive them as being grouped together.



![Common region Gestalt principle](https://www.usertesting.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/common-regions_0.png)



#### Closure

The principle of closure states that when we look at a complex  arrangement of visual elements, we tend to look for a single,  recognizable pattern.



![Example of the closure principle - IBM logo](https://www.usertesting.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/ibm-logo-630x252.png)





#### Continuity

The principle of continuity states that elements that are arranged on a  line or curve are perceived to be more related than elements not on the  line or curve.

#### Perception

The Gestalt principle of perception is when people instinctively  perceive objects as either figure (the focal point) or ground  (background).



### Contrast

Contrast help the user know where to focus. Not only are we showing only a barchart fx we have colored the charts where we want the user to glance. 



### Recipy for cleaning datavis

1. Remove chart border
2. Remove gridlines
3. Remove datamarker
4. Clean up axis labels
5. Label data directly
6. Use consistent colors



### Exercise

Take a look at a graph and clean it up





## Misleading with data
