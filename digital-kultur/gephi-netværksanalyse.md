# Network analysis

## Exercise 1

In the tool: https://osome.iu.edu/tools/networks/

Query the hashtag: #Barbie / retweets and quotes

- Why does the hashtag gain that much traction? 
- Who are the top authorities on the subject?
- How can the network be described?

Query the hashtag: #Marathon / retweets and quotes

- Who are the top authorities on the subject? 
- How can the network be described?



## Exercise 2: Visualising network data

Download Gephi:

- https://gephi.org/

Dataset:

- https://github.com/Veruka2021/Spotify-Network-Artist_2024_gexf/blob/main/Spotify%20Network%20Artist_Python_2024_Vero.gexf

Answer the following questions:

- What data does the dataset contain? 
- How is the data visualised?
- How does the following parameters change the visualisation? 
  - Coloring nodes by *modularity*
  - Ranking size by *followers*
  - Adjusting font size by *followers*
- Visualise the data such that:
  - The largest artists by followers are visible.
  - Each cluster is colored by their modularity class.




## Exercise 3: 

Download the **[airlines](https://github.com/gephi/gephi.github.io/blob/master/datasets/airlines-sample.gexf)** dataset

Import the dataset into Gephi

- Use a visualisation to identify and communicate the largest airports in the United States.



## Exercise 4:

Find a dataset or build a dataset and visualise the network in Gephi.

- The dataset can be generated by 
  - Downloading .csv data
  - Generating dummy data from a LLM
  - Adding data as nodes in Gephi
    - You can use knowledge / data from your Digital Kultur project
