# Which type of visualisation



- Simple text
- Table
- Heatmap slopegraph
- Scatterplot
- Line
- Barchart

- Circle diagram
- Map



Tips:

- Pie charts are evil. donut and circle some times evil
- Never use 3D
- No secondary y-axis
  - Too much to decode



So how to choose?

- What do you want to say?
  - Some example of a graph where you can say a lot of things

- When you know that, start thinking in charts.
